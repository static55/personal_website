Note: This is a work in progress. I'll likely be updating the designs of the 3D printed parts and adding/updating features.

<h3>Overview</h3>

<h3>Ballscrews & Bearings</h3>
<br />
Here's is Franco's overview. In the description of this video on YouTube is a link to an excellent <a href="https://a360.co/2wZuXhC">interactive 3D model of his PM-25MV conversion</a> that I've found myself referring to many, many times during my conversion.

Definitely subscribe to Franco and watch all his PM-25MV conversion videos if you haven't already.

I bought Chai's ballscrews & ballnuts off E-Bay:

<br />
And then I straightened Chai's ballscrews:

<br />
Here are the angular contact bearings I bought:
<br />
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OOjXZ0Xwm8k" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
The FK bearings are pre-loaded, so (I guess?) you don't need to worry about over/under-tightening the lock nut that holds them in place.

<h3>Screws, Nuts. Washers</h3>

Buy an assortment of m4 and m5 screws/nuts/washers on AliExpress including:

<ul>
<li>3 90mm m5 screws to attach z motor mount together</li>
<li>4 60mm m5 screws to attach z ballnut to ballnut holder</li>
<li>4 20mm m5 screws to attach z motor mount to mill</li>
<li>4 30mm m5 screws to attach z motor to motor mount</li>
<li>2 50mm m3 screws to attach x ballnut to ballnut holder
(Or 2 50mm m4 screws? I think I redisigned the x ballnut holder for m3 because I didn't have 50mm m4.)</li>
<li>2 35mm m4 screws to attach y ballnut to ballnut holder</li>
<li>An assortment of m4 screws of sizes <= 25mm (25, 20, 16, 14, 12) to attach FK bearings to plastic parts.</li>
<li>m5 nuts</li>
<li>m4 nuts</li>
<li>An assortment of m3, m4, m5 washers (helps prevent the screws from digging into the plastic parts)</li>
</ul>

It wouldn't surprise me if I've forgotten some screws or got some lengths wrong.. You can always cut a long screw down to make a smaller one in a pinch so it might be a good idea to get a few extra long m4 and m5 screws just in case. Perhaps some long m3 screws too.

<h3>Electronics</h3>

<br />
Here are the motors, drivers, and power supplies I purchased:
<br />

<br />
Here is my (mostly completed) electronics enclosure:
<br />
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GYaf3dt6IW8" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
<br />

It'd probably be best to buy an enclosure with a PLASTIC backplate. Or make your own backplate.  Drilling and tapping holes in the metal backplate sucked. Not to mention 3d printing custom plastic stand-offs for everything in it.
<br /><br />
Using spade connectors on the wires screwed to the bus bars also would have been smart. (I didn't.)

I forgot to mention in this video that I filled the void between the metal and epoxy parts with epoxy.
